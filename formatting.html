title: Formatting Stylish&#8217;s output

<div class="section">
  <p>
    Stylish&#8217;s default formatting of its output might not be your liking, or
    fit in with the house style used in your hand-written stylesheets.
    Fortunately, its output is easily configurable by setting the
    <code>format</code> attribute on the relevant classes, as can be seen in the
    following example.
  </p>

{% highlight ruby %}style = Stylish.generate do
  div :color => "000", :letter_spacing => "0.1em"
  em :font_style => "italic"
  strong :font_weight => "bold"
  p :margin_bottom => "10px"
end

           # With Stylish's default formatting...
           #
style.to_s # => div {color:#000; letter-spacing:0.1em;}
           #    em {font-style:italic}
           #    strong {font-weight:bold;}
           #    p {margin-bottom:10px;}

Stylish::Rule.format = "%s {\n  %s\n}\n"
Stylish::Declarations.format = "\n  "
Stylish::Declaration.format = "%s: %s;"

           # ...and using our new formatting choices:
           #
style.to_s # => div {
           #      color: #000;
           #      letter-spacing: 0.1em;
           #    }
           #
           #    em {
           #      font-style: italic;
           #    }
           #
           #    strong {
           #      font-weight: bold;
           #    }
           #
           #    p {
           #      margin-bottom: 10px;
           #    }{% endhighlight %}

  <p>
    The following classes in the <code>Stylish</code> namespace all have a
    <code>format</code> attribute which can be changed to adjust way their output
    is serialised:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>Stylesheet</code>:
      controls how rules are joined together. Defaults to a single line break.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <code>Tree::SelectorScope</code>:
      controls how rules within a particular selector scope are joined, just
      like <code>Stylesheet</code> does at the top level. Defaults to a single
      line break.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <code>Rule</code>:
      controls the joining of selectors and declarations. Defaults to a single
      space between the selectors and the opening brace of the declarations, and
      no whitespace between the braces and the declarations themselves.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <code>Selectors</code>:
      controls how selectors are joined together. Defaults to a single space
      after the required comma.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <code>Declarations</code>:
      controls how selectors are joined together; defaults to a single space.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <code>Declaration</code>:
      controls how individual declarations are formatted; defaults to include
      no whitespace.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <code>PropertyBundle</code>:
      controls how property values with multiple values are formatted. Defaults
      to a single space after the required comma.
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <code>Image</code>:
      controls how <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> values
      are formatted. Defaults to wrapping values in single quotes with no
      whitespace (double quotes and no quotation marks are valid alternatives).
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
