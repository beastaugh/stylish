title: Using Ruby 1.9 with Stylish
---

<div class="section">
  <p>
    Stylish is fully compatible with Ruby 1.9, although it doesn&#8217;t
    require it. Amongst other things, this means that if you&#8217;re running
    Ruby 1.9, you can take advantage of its new shorthand hash literal syntax.
    As the following example demonstrates, this makes code written in Stylish
    look even cleaner and more like CSS.
  </p>

{% highlight ruby %}style = Stylish.generate do
  body color: "333" do
    em font_style: "italic"
    strong font_weight: "bold", color: "f00"
    p margin_bottom: "1em"
    rule "#header", background: {image: "header.png", repeat: "no-repeat"}
  end
end{% endhighlight %}
</div>
