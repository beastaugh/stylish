Stylish
=======

[Stylish](http://github.com/ionfish/stylish/) is a tool for writing <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr> with Ruby.


Future considerations
---------------------

* The Color class will need to support [RGBA](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/).
* Groupings of rules could be handled much better.
* There should be a simple, intelligent way to add comments to stylesheets.
* Fundamental objects like percentages and URIs need their own classes rather than being dealt with in an ad-hoc manner by higher-level objects.
* There are too many monolithic classes and methods.
